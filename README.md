# HUDProject
## This project was an exploratory analysis of the heads-up displays (HUDs) from popular videogames.

I examined whether videogame HUDs have gotten smaller over time to increase the level of immersion that gamers feel. I wrote up the results and posted them to [medium](https://medium.com/@joshmoskowitz/size-does-matter-an-analysis-of-videogame-huds-24321750b665).
